Problem 1. 
	a) 1, 4
	b) 2, 3, 4
	c) 4
	d) 2
	e) 2, 3, 4, 5

Problem 2.
	a) none
	b) 1, 2, 3
	c) 1. git add hw1q2b.cpp
		  git commit -m "homework question 2b"
		  git push
	   2. git log -p -3
	d) git would commit all three files, and they would be ready to be pushed to git
	e) git clone git@github.com::usc-csci104-spring2018/hw-adelaydr.git

Problem 4.  
	1. when funcA([1,2,3,4,5], 5) is called, the output is:
		1 
		2
		3
		4
		5
	because funcB will be called on the array [1,2,3,4,5] with min 0 and
	max 5 (array size), and this function then uses recursive calls to 
	split up the array into the upper and lower half repeatedly, printing 
	the value in the array at an index once the max and min are equal. The
	recursive function will print each number in order and only once, 
	because it begins by calling the min and max representing the first 
	half of the array, followed by the second, and therefore reaches every
	number in order. 
	2. funcB will fail to terminate when the min is greater than the max. 
	when the max is greater (or equal to) than the min , funcB will always 
	terminate because the max and min will continue to be called 
	recursively so that they will eventually be equal. 
	3. output:
		a[min]
		a[1]
		a[2]
		a[3]
		... (add one to index each time)
		a[max-1]
		a[max]
	 as explained in question 1, the recursion will continue divding the 
	 array until narrowed down to the same min and max value, and print the
	 value at this index starting with the min and leading up to the max 
	 in order
